Student-focused Canvas integration for Home Assistant: courses, grades, upcoming assignments, missing work, and announcements.  
Multi-school support, per-school options, token validation, and drop-in Markdown cards that auto-discover schools.

See examples in `examples/cards/` and the integration in `custom_components/canvas_student/`.
